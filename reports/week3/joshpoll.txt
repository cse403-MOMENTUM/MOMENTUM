N/A

Actual Progress
========================
- Arranged time for team to meet in person.
- Attended team and client meetings.
- Compiled a significant portion of the list of existing tools and published papers.
- Researched PSP and PROBE.
- Wrote section on existing tools and methods for project proposal.
- Contributed ideas for deepening scope of project and combining existing methods in new ways.

I am still having trouble finding useful research, especially on the
effectiveness of existing tools. I'm also not sure what is realistic for our
group in the time that we have.

4/10-4/16 Goals
========================
- Find more research papers, and read those, and papers we've already found,thoroughly.
- Investigate how to implement the uncertainty visualization strategies
described in IDL's recent papers. Possibly ask an author for code.
- Contribute to architecture and implementation overview.
- Try to find existing solutions for automating PROBE.
    - If none exist, think about why they don't exist.
    - Assess the difficulty of implementing such a tool.
