# How to get setup (assuming macOS).
1. Install HomeBrew
2. Install Node: `brew install node`
3. Install TypeScript: `npm i -g typescript`

The setup above is probably incomplete. Let Josh know about setup issues.

The project was tested using VSCode . YMMV with other tools.

# Running
From `/momentum`:
- `npm start` starts the dev server (use this for development)
- `npm run build` compiles an optimized version of project (use this for deployment)
- `npm test` runs tests
