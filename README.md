# How to get setup (assuming macOS).
1. Install HomeBrew
2. Install Node: `brew install node`
3. Install TypeScript: `npm i -g typescript`

The setup above is probably incomplete. Let Josh know about setup issues.

The project was tested using VSCode . YMMV with other tools.

# Running

- `npm start` starts the dev server (use this for development). the site will update automatically when you edit files
- `npm test` runs tests
- `npm run deploy` builds the site **and pushes to gh-pages branch**
